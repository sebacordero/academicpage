A brief travel to Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.

In this first approach, we will make a brief tour of the history of money and how we got to the current situation. We will continue with a basic idea of what the chain of blocks (or Blockchain) is. We will talk about cryptography and the use of both the public keys and the private keys of the wallets (or Wallets). Lastly and most importantly, we as users today have the responsibility of defending our own future.
